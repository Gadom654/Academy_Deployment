Why Argo CD is beneficial for deploying applications
It allows us to deploy new version of application as soon as it arives to repo and it keeps state of application in the same version as it is in repo.
Why mTLS is valuable in Kubernetes clusters
It secures network inside cluster so that connections between pods are encrypted.
When Argo CD should NOT be used and why
When you are not using Kubernetes or when you are using building scripts, it is only CD tool.
When mTLS / Service Mesh should NOT be used and why
It should be used when we need best possible performance or we have a lot of small containers like in IoT.
Also we should not use it when we already have encryption builded inside application or we use UDP instead of TCP.
